# RESEARCH — TGF (condensed)

## Executive summary
Green finance and green fintech are converging to redirect capital toward sustainable projects by combining financial products with digital verification, monitoring, and reporting. Technologies such as AI, blockchain and IoT enable impact measurement, fraud prevention and real-time monitoring, but the field faces major gaps: funding shortfalls for large decarbonization projects, fragmented regulation and pervasive greenwashing. This research synthesizes these drivers and risks to inform TGF’s MVP strategy.

## Problem statement
- Capital allocation for climate solutions is insufficient and fragmented.  
- Market trust is low because impact claims are often unverifiable (greenwashing).  
- Standardized, high-quality ESG and impact data is rare and inconsistent.

## Market opportunity
- Growing consumer and investor demand for verifiable green products (retail + SME segments).  
- Regulatory momentum toward disclosure and taxonomies increases demand for compliance tooling.  
- Platforms that combine measurable environmental impact with clear financial benefits have a strong adoption edge.

## Relevant technologies (summary)
- **AI/ML:** risk assessment, fraud/greenwashing detection, impact estimation, and personalization.
- **Blockchain:** immutable records useful for transparent carbon credits and traceability.
- **IoT:** real-world sensor data for verifiable monitoring feeding models and reports.

## Key challenges & constraints
- **Green premium & mobilization gap:** nascent tech needs de-risking mechanisms.
- **Regulatory fragmentation:** different taxonomies and disclosure rules across jurisdictions.
- **Data quality:** ESG data inconsistency and methodological complexity (e.g., LCA).
- **Trust & greenwashing:** requires transparent methods, third-party verification or strong audit trails.
- **AI footprint:** use AI efficiently and measure its own environmental impact.

## Implications for TGF (how this shapes product decisions)
1. **Dual-value focus:** product must deliver measurable environmental impact plus clear financial/operational benefits to users and partners.
2. **Start lean on verification:** MVP should use conservative, auditable estimation tables and clear disclaimers rather than claiming audit-grade accuracy.
3. **Design for trust:** store provenance metadata for actions and transactions (prepare for future blockchain anchoring).
4. **Regulatory posture:** build reporting-friendly outputs (CSV/PDF) and map to common standards (GRI/TCFD/SDG) later.
5. **Commercial hints from EcoCapital Exchange:** platform + marketplace + verification mix (project listings, impact metrics, funding flows) is a viable revenue angle to explore.

## Immediate recommendations (MVP scope)
- Implement an **Impact Estimator v0.1** using simple, transparent lookup tables and a clear “indicative only” label.
- Build a **Knowledge Hub** with curated, referenced content that links to suggested actions.
- Provide **downloadable reports** for users and SMEs to support compliance and partner conversations.
- Keep PII minimal, adopt privacy-by-design and secure storage from day one.
