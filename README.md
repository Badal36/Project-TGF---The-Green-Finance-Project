# 🌍 TGF – The Green Finance Project

The Green Finance Project (TGF) is a private initiative exploring how technology and finance can work together to build sustainable solutions. The goal is to create tools, platforms, and resources that help startups, businesses, and communities align with global sustainability goals while staying practical and scalable.  

## 🚀 Current Status
This repository is in its **early stage**. Right now, it’s just the foundation—documentation, research, and project structure are being set up before development begins.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `docs/` → Research papers, reports, and planning documents  
- `src/` → Project source code (coming soon)  
- `tests/` → Testing framework and scripts  
- `data/` → Datasets and resources  

## 📌 Roadmap (Draft)
1. Set up repository structure ✅  
2. Document project goals and direction (in progress)  
3. Build a web-based MVP platform  
4. Expand features and tools for businesses/startups  
5. Later: develop a mobile application (APK)  

## 🤝 Collaboration
At this stage, the project is private and under active development. Future contributions, partnerships, and open resources will be planned once the foundation is solid.
